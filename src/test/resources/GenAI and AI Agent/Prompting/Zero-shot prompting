A) Zero-shot prompting: No examples, AI guess format.

    - Example (Travel):

    - Prompt: "How long does it take from SFO to New York?"

    - Output: Flight Time, Car Travel, Walking Time, Too Much Information


Adding Constraints for Clarity:

    - Basic Constraint:

    Prompt: "How long by car from SFO to New York?"
    Output: "About 41 hours driving".

    - Improved Constraint:

    Prompt: "List down sightseen spots in route by car, but include only those with
             <1 hour detour."

    - Layering Constraint for Best Result:

    Prompt: "List sightseeing sports en route by car, <=1 hour detour, must be historical
             landmarks"

    Output: Focused, Relevant, and Aligned with the Goal
