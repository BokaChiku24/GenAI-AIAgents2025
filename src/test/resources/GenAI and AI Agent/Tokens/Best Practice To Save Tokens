Best Practice To Save Tokens

1) Be precise from the start

   - Avoid vague, open-ended prompts

2) Remove unnecessary filter words.

3) Summarize or restate important info

   - Instead of pasting full documents repeatedly

4) Use role + context + constraints

   - In one compact prompt

5) Chunk large tasks

   - Split into smaller queries if they don't depend on the each other
