Why Prompt Engineering Matters in QA:

1) AI output depends on context, constraint, and clarity.

2) Similar to writing test cases and acceptance criteria - vague one causes confusion.

3) Poor prompts -> Hallucination + Wasted Time + Wasted Token.

4) Poor Prompt:

Zero-shot prompt example (Travel):

Output: Flight Time, Car Travel, Walking Time, Too Much Information
