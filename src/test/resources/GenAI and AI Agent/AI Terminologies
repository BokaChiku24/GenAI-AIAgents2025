1) Large Language Models (LLM)

-> LLMs are the backbone of AI applications. These models are trained on vast amount of data,
   enabling them to understand human language, process context, and generate meaningful
   responses. We often interact with LLMs through AI Assistants/Applications and Chatbots.

2) AI Assistants/Applications:

-> This include tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and other Gen AI-powered solutions that assist testers
   to enhance productivity by providing intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive task.

3) AI Agents:
